    <p class="text-muted">Libraries are major sources of information for society and they serve as guardians of the public's access to 
        information. The advent of the digital world has revolutionized how the public obtains its information and how libraries provide

              has multiple uses to organize celebrations and recreational activities. A majority of schools use their auditorium on a daily
               basis for their morning prayers and assembly.</p>

        Organization and independence are important sixth-grade skills. Sixth graders need to understand place value and be able to work
         with decimals up to the hundredths place. Sixth graders have to write to provide information, to support their opinion, and to
          tell a story. Although 6th grade will be harder than 5th grade, if you work hard and try your best, it will be fine. Is the
           middle school easy to get lost in? Although the middle school is large, it is laid out so that it is hard to get lost in.
